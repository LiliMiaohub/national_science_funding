# Reproducing:

Load the provided conda environment, provided in `funding.yml`, using the command `conda env create -f funding.yml`. Then be sure to activate this environment in your working directory using `conda activate myenv`.


You can download the simulated data for this analysis at [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Cooperation_and_interdependence_in_global_science_funding/25270075). The simulated data comprises 5% of publications used in our analysis, with randomized paper IDs, authorship affiliation countries and randomized funding countries. It is important to note that the simulated dataset is not suitabla for reproducing the results presented in the paper; its purpose is solely to validate the source code. For access to the Web of Science dataset used in the main analysis, readers are encouraged to contact Thomson Reuters through the following [URL](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/scholarly-scientific-research/scholarly-search-and-discovery/web-of-science.html).

Create a file called `workflow/PROJ_HOME_DIR` that has a path to the root data folder. For example, `/Dropbox/SME-Dropbox/`.


Change directory to the `workflow` directory and run the `snakemake` command. You can find more information about running snakemake in [the wiki](https://github.com/murrayds/sci-mobility-emb/wiki/Snakemake). This will produce the final figures and all intermediary data used in the research project. As much data as possible has been provided to speed up this process, but it will take some time.
